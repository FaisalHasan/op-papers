\maketitle


On Friday, 8 June at 10:00 AM we will begin our approximately two one operations evaluation period which will end on Friday, 15 June at 23:59.  During this time we will not meet as a class.

You will be evaluated on the following criteria:

1.  \textbf{ownCloud Uptime (50 marks):}  Your primary goal is to keep ownCloud running.  If you keep ownCloud running for 180 (~99\%) hours during this period, you will receive 50 marks.  If you have less than 130 hours of uptime (~70\%) you will receive 0 marks.  Every hour between the two is worth 1 mark.  Uptime is measured by an instance of Nagios.  Note that you will not lose marks if there is an outage in the VMWare platform or the Polytechnic network - but if you suspect that such a problem is occurring you should verify that this is the case.

If you do the arithmetic you'll see that there are two hours unaccounted for.  We will get to that.

2.  \textbf{Issues/Tickets (20 marks):}  During the evaluation period you will receive tickets to handle.  Some tickets will come from a standard user (user@sqrawler.com).  You are only expected to deal with those tickets during normal business hours (9-5 Monday-Friday).  You will also receive tickets from your manager (it-manager@sqrawler.com).  You are expected to handle those tickets between 8:00 and 22:00 any day of the week.  

For these tickets you will be evaluated based on:

   - effectively resolving the issues;
   - handling them promptly;
   - communicating with relevant parties

3.  \textbf{Security Breach/System Failure (20 marks):}  At some point during the evaluation period you will have to deal with a major systems failure or a security breach.  (This is where the two hours of downtime come in).  You will be evaluated on:

  - recognising the problem;
  - solving the problem;
  - communicating with affected parties (e.g., the two email addresses above).

4.  \textbf{Bacula/Nagios/Puppet setup (10 marks):} I will review your utilisation of Bacula, Nagios, and Puppet.  Note that I will do this near the end of the evaluation period, so you should use the time to improve your use of these tools if necessary.

During the evaluation (and before it starts)I will be available to answer questions and clarify things as needed.

You should post a schedule on your team wiki identifying a primary contact person from your team for every hour of the assessment.
